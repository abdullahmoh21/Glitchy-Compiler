## Overview

Glitchy is an educational programming language developed to combine favorite elements from various languages while creating an engaging platform for learning both programming and compiler design. It's a Python-based Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that compiles to LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), providing real-time execution and high performance.

One of the unique aspects of Glitchy is the incorporation of random "glitches," turning coding into an interactive challenge where users must troubleshoot unexpected behavior and learn through dynamic multiple-choice questions (MCQs).

The goal with Glitchy is to demystify compilers, removing the sense of "black magic" often associated with them. Users are encouraged not just to write code but to also gain insights into what happens behind the scenes during compilation. This is achieved through detailed optional logs that show each step of the compilation process. Users are also encouraged to explore the compiler code itself!

The language features type inference, optional annotations, and a quirky type-checking system. For instance, Glitchy supports variable type strings, so `int`, `inte`, `integ`, and `integer` are all valid integer types. With Glitchy, you'll not only debug your code but also the compiler : )

## Features

- **Basic Constructs**: Includes `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while` loops, and functions (see [samples](samples)).

- **Type Inference**: Automatically infers the data type of variables without requiring explicit type declarations.

  ```glitchy
  set num = 10  // num is inferred as integer
  set name = "Glitchy"  // name is inferred as string
  ```

- **Optional Type Annotations**: Users can provide type annotations, which the compiler enforces.

  ```glitchy
  set num:int = 10
  set name:string = "Glitchy"
  ```

- **Flexible Type Names**: Allows various acceptable type names (e.g., `int`, `inte`, `integ`, etc.) for the same underlying type. All these examples are valid:

  ```glitchy
  set num:int = 10
  set num:integ = 10
  set num:integer = 10
  ```

  ```glitchy
  set name:str = "Hello"
  set name:string = "World"
  ```

- **Flexible Type Comparison**: When checking the type of data using the `typeof(some_value)` function, which returns a string like `"boolean"`, Glitchy allows flexibility in type comparison. The compiler automatically normalizes type names during comparisons, enabling the following:

  ```glitchy
    set x = true
    typeof(x) == "bool"         // true
    typeof(x) == "boolean"      // true
  ```

  However, normal string comparisons remain unchanged:

  ```glitchy
    "str" == "string" // false
  ```

## Glitches

The Glitch feature introduces controlled unexpected behavior in the program whenever the function `glitch()` is called. This function triggers a game that tests users on their ability to debug and troubleshoot code. When a glitch is triggered, the program introduces a controlled glitches and runs the "glitched" code instead.

After execution, users are shown the output or error generated and are asked through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to determine what happened. This encourages deeper understanding and problem-solving skills. Possible glitches include:

- **Logical Operation Inversion:** Logical operators like && (and) could be inverted to || (or)
- **Comparison Operator Flipping:** Comparison operators could be flipped (e.g., == to !=)
- **Ignored Function Calls:** Certain function calls might be ignored and not executed.
- **Function Body Swapping:** The bodies of two functions could be swapped.
- **Arithmetic Operator Change:** An arithmetic operator could be randomly changed (e.g., `+` to `*`).
- **Variable Swapping:** The values of two variables could be swapped.
- **Random Variable Alteration:** A variable's value could be randomly altered, potentially changing its type.
- **Variable Reference Redirection:** Variable references could point to different variables.
- **No Glitch:** Sometimes, no glitches are introduced to test your confidence in your own code

This feature turns coding into an interactive learning experience, helping users to understand not just the code they write but also how unexpected changes can affect program behavior.

## Installation

To install the Glitchy compiler, ensure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system.

1. **Install Python and `pip`**:

   - You can download Python (which includes `pip`) from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdullahmoh21/Glitchy-Compiler.git
   cd glitchy
   ```

3. **Install Glitchy** and its dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run Glitchy files using the following command:

```bash
glitchy example/file.g --log [level]
```

_Log levels can be optionally set from 1 to 3 using the log flag_

## Examples

- **Ackermann Function**:

```glitchy
// Highly recursive Ackermann function
function int ackermann(m:int, n:integer) {
    print("Ackermann called!")
    if (m == 0) {
        return n + 1
    } elif (m > 0 && n == 0) {
        return ackermann(m - 1, 1)
    } else {
        return ackermann(m - 1, ackermann(m, n - 1))
    }
}

set m = input().toInteger()
set n = input().toInteger()
print("Ackermann(" + m + ", " + n + ") = " + ackermann(m, n))
```

- **Collatz Conjecture**:

```glitchy
function void collatz(n:int) {
    print("Starting number: " + n)
    set steps = 0

    while (n != 1) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n = n / 2
        } else {
            n = n * 3 + 1
        }
        print("Next number: " + n)
        steps++
    }

    print("Collatz Conjecture completed in " + steps + " steps.")
}

set num = input().toInteger()
collatz(num)
```
